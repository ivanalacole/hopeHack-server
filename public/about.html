        <h1>Who Are You?</h1>
        <p>We are a newly developed grassroots non-profit organization aiming to make proper healthcare be better accessible to 
            women and girls across the nation. We want to ensure that women’s physical, psychological, and mental
             needs are being addressed and cared for properly. We believe that organizations like ours will help 
             further minimize the quality of service gap between men and women. We also want to ensure that women 
             and girls get diagnosed as accurately as possible so that they may receive swift and effective treatment.
        </p>

        <h1>Why Did You Create UMatter?</h1>
        <p>Mistreatment and misdiagnosis of women’s illnesses is a very unexplored topic that affects millions of women. 
            There have been plenty of articles over the years of women being misdiagnosed as ‘hypochondriacs’ 
            only for them to come across doctors that soon discover serious health problems that have been left untreated.
             The most recent case that has come to our attention was a 23 year-old woman diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 
             and ADHD suddenly finding out that she had hydrocephalus, a rare condition in which excessive fluid compresses
              the brain’s frontal lobe <small>[1]</small>. There have been bigger scandals that have gotten nationwide coverage i.e. Larry 
              Nassar’s sexual abuse case in which he had mistreated young Olympic hopefuls for over a decade. 
            There is also a disparity in how women’s bodies are studied as women were not involved in clinical trials until
             1990. While women make up 70% of chronic pain patients, 80% of pain medications have been tested solely on men<small>[2]</small>.
              Women have a 50% chance of being misdiagnosed after a heart attack and a 33% chance of being misdiagnosed after a
               stroke. And in cases like childbirth, certain disparities are exponentially increased. For example, black women 
               are five times more likely to die during childbirth due to cardiomyopathy and/or other blood-pressure related 
               issues<small>[3]</small>. 
            </p>

        <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
        <p>We set up funding accounts for abortion rights clinics nationwide so that every woman may have access to safe procedures
            without having to travel to far. We also have doctor lookup APIs built into our interface on the 'Find A Doctor' page that
            lets you look up doctors of different
